# Introduction

Welcome to the CDE Data Guide! This document is intended to describe procedures used to set up R studio and the GitHub repositories used by CDE’s ACI team. After completing this process, you should be able to access and run scripts that pull data from CDE’s warehouse (WH) directly through R Studio.
